# DvorakCustom

A custom implementation of Dvorak which relocates certain keys based off a combination of logical grouping and comfort.

The full keyboard is, when typed on an ANSI keyboard:

\`1234567890[]

;,.pyfgcrl/=\\

aoeuidhtns-

'qjkxbmwvz

SHIFT:

~&@#$%^<>(){}

:!?PYFGCRL\*+|

AOEUIDHTNS\_

"QJKXBMWVZ

In future I will publish an image for this layout which describes the location of characters on keys, including an extended description of grouping logic.

The decisions have been made as follows:

- All alphabetical and punctuation symbols are included in the lower 3 rows, except for parenthesis.

- All bracketing characters are on the top row, on the left. They are ordered roughly according to the priority () <> [] {}.

- Numerical characters are all on the top row from 1-9 then 0.

- All sentence-dividing characters ";,.:!?" are listed in the top row. These are prioritized firstly by frequency, and secondly by symbolic similarity. As such ; and : are together, while . and , occupy two separate keys (as the most commonly used punctuation).

- The 4 arithmetic operations +-/\* are located on the right of the keyboard.

- \- and _ are on the same key due to graphical similarity

- \ and | are together on the far right as two uncommon characters with great graphical similarity

- " and ' are together at the bottom of the keyboard. ' is treated equally to alphabetic characters firstly as it appears in words in various languages alongside alphabetical text, and secondly because some languages and transcription systems do treat it as its own character.

- " is together with ' due to graphical similarity and similar function

- All other symbols are placed to the left of the top row and placed in a near-traditional order (adjusted due to the movement of <>)
